# Echo usage showcase

This repository contains some simple examples of real-world use cases for the [Echo](https://echo.chainbound.io) RPC.

## Available examples

- Telegram bot operation: how a Telegram trading bot developer could use Echo to manage the transaction flow of their bot.
- Uniswap Arbitrage bot: how a MEV searcher doing arbitrage could use Echo to send bundles programmatically to the network.

These exmples are implemented in Rust ([here](./rust/)) and in Typescript ([here](./typescript/)).
Please refer to the language-specific READMEs for more information.
The scripts are self-contained and can be run directly from the command line, no additional dependencies are required!
